services :
1) legal office: Our legal office is made up of women working as lawyers who are experts in civil law and criminal law on gender-based violence and the defense of the rights of women and their children. Women that request this service are then supported through the entire legal route until the final sentence. Our ultimate goal is to change through our work the discriminatory way in which women victims of violence are treated by the legal system. In particular our goals are: Innovate judicial culture through the study of EU sources and international organizations on gender-based violence, develop defense strategies and judicial practices for the benefit of women and children who have suffered violence, research the most innovative criminal, civil and international case law. The legal office, in offering its legal advice and assistance, aims to carry out an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional intervention, working in close synergy with the psychologists, operators and all the other professional figures present in the Women's Solidarity Center to ensure that each woman receives a targeted and specific intervention.
2) psychological support: Our center offers free counseling sessions for women victims of violence. Our team includes women working as counselors and psychologists which can help and support women in difficult, stressful and traumatic situations. Our center also offers psychological support for children of victims of violence. Our goal is to help women and children to get out of violent situations, through a safe and judgment-free environment. 
3) shelter house: Our center offers safe and secret housing for women and children that are forced to leave their homes because of a dangerous and violent environment. With our support, they can safely start their path to get out of a violent environment. If you’re in a dangerous situation and you need to leave your home, contact us. A member of our staff will guide you through every step to get you to a safe location.
4) support for professional training: Work, or its absence, determines the economic autonomy and thus the future of women who want to get out of ill-treatment and violence. The objectives of the help desk are the orientation and re-orientation in both professional and personal terms of the woman and the facilitation of access to employment opportunities. We also offer facilitated access to professional training courses to help and facilitate women to find suitable employment in the shortest time possible.
5) medical support: At Women's Solidarity Center, we understand the profound importance of choice and autonomy for women who have experienced the harrowing effects of violence. Our service assists survivors in finding safe and compassionate medical centers that provide abortion care. We protect the right of women’s bodily autonomy, and our team is committed to offering nonjudgmental support and guidance throughout the process. With sensitivity and empathy, we help survivors navigate the complex and often hostile healthcare system, connecting them with reputable medical facilities that prioritize their well-being and dignity. Our advocates stand by survivors, offering emotional support and resources to ensure they feel empowered and informed every step of the way. In a world where violence seeks to silence and control, we strive to be a beacon of support and compassion, guiding survivors towards the care and healing they deserve.
6) Self-help/mutual aid groups: The Self-Mutual Help groups are based on a culture of solidarity rather than welfarism, and are therefore new ways of coping with situations of personal distress. Through these groups, a rich and diverse circulation of experiences and ways of thinking is made possible, resulting in the opportunity to expand the boundaries of one's own experience and perspectives. Although these groups live essentially on the value of confrontation between the participants, each meeting is coordinated by a professional provided by our center. Our center organizes mutual aid groups focused on specific aspects, such as personal hygiene and food hygiene, and parental support. Groups on self-knowledge and self-care: These are meetings on personal hygiene and food hygiene. They are conducted by a medical information specialist and a dietician, starting with the motivations that prevent women from taking care of themselves and discussing suitable paths for achieving their own wellbeing. Such interventions are necessary because almost always the women who are accommodated, overwhelmed by difficulties, forget about themselves in a crescendo of 'neglect', which also involves children. The parenting support group: for women accompanied by minor children, a pathway is provided to strengthen the affective relationship between mother and child through parenting support.

project:
1) Raising Awareness About Gender Based Violence: 'Breaking Silence: Empowering Youth Against Gender-Based Violence', is a comprehensive initiative aimed at raising awareness about gender-based violence in schools. Through a multifaceted approach, we engage students, educators, and parents in dialogue and action to address this pressing issue. Our project involves interactive workshops, educational seminars, and awareness campaigns tailored to different age groups and educational levels. We collaborate closely with school administrators and teachers to integrate our curriculum into existing programs, ensuring maximum impact and relevance. By providing resources, support, and training, we empower students to recognize the signs of abuse, challenge harmful stereotypes, and foster healthy relationships built on respect and consent. Additionally, we offer specialized training for educators to effectively address gender-based violence in the classroom and create safe spaces for survivors to seek support. Through community partnerships and advocacy efforts, we aim to create a ripple effect of change, transforming school cultures into ones that reject violence and embrace equality.
2) Volounteer and Staff Training: 'Volunteer and Staff Training Program', is a project dedicated to equipping volunteers and staff with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively support women who are victims of violence. Through a rigorous training curriculum developed by experts in the field, participants learn about trauma-informed care, crisis intervention techniques, cultural sensitivity, and legal advocacy. The program combines theoretical learning with practical exercises and role-playing scenarios to ensure that volunteers and staff are well-prepared to handle diverse situations with empathy and professionalism. Additionally, participants receive ongoing support and mentorship from experienced professionals within the organization, fostering a supportive community of caregivers. By investing in the training and development of our volunteers and staff, we strive to provide the highest quality of care and support to survivors of violence, empowering them to rebuild their lives with dignity and resilience. Together, we can create a network of compassionate and skilled individuals dedicated to ending the cycle of violence and promoting a future where all women can live free from fear.
3) Self-Defense Courses: Our association has an ongoing collaboration with local gyms and experienced instructors to offer self-defense courses for girls and women. These courses provide participants with valuable skills and techniques to protect themselves and assert their boundaries in challenging situations. Led by trained professionals, the courses focus on practical self-defense strategies tailored to the needs and abilities of participants. Through a combination of physical training, verbal assertiveness, and situational awareness exercises, women learn how to defend themselves effectively while also gaining confidence and empowerment. Additionally, the supportive and inclusive environment of the courses fosters a sense of community and solidarity among participants, creating a safe space for learning and growth. By equipping women with the tools they need to defend themselves, we aim to empower them to reclaim their sense of agency and security. Together, we can help women break free from the cycle of violence and build a future where they can live fearlessly and independently.
4) Support For Orphans of Victims of Feminicide: The project "Orphan of Femicide, Invisible Victim" promoted by the Iside cooperative, aims to implement integrated and multidisciplinary interventions capable of promptly and individually addressing femicide orphans and their families. The project is designed to protect and support femicide orphans through an operational perspective towards the orphans themselves and their caregivers, with a focus on their specific condition and needs. The common objective is to promote the development of effective practices and knowledge in supporting orphans and families, moving them out of invisibility and into a more welcoming and empowered community. Project interventions provide targeted support to orphans and their families in all stages, starting from the immediate aftermath of the traumatic event, specialized support for trauma repair in the medium and long term, pathways for social reintegration, and full professional/work autonomy. Among the project actions, there are planned paths of psycho-social, psychological, legal, educational, psychotherapeutic, and vocational support for orphans aged between 0 and 21, while foster families/caregivers are offered support measures in their relationship with the orphan and in managing material needs. Finally, the project includes capacity building actions, such as training and prevention, to build a network of increasingly competent professionals and particularly coordinate between public and private services with the aim of intervening collectively, identifying best practices. The hope is to reduce the terrible consequences that femicide has on the children of the murdered woman, the family, and the community in general.
5) Aid for Migrant Women and Children: This project consists of the reception of migrant and asylum-seeking women, alone or with children, in an independent secret house, where up to ten women, possibly with children, can be accommodated. The women are supported by professional operators, such as educators, psychologists and mediators, who guarantee constant presence and accompaniment throughout the entire process of leaving violence behind and until full emotional, relational, economic and housing autonomy is achieved. Ample space is given to supporting the re-elaboration of the personal history and trauma experienced as a result of the violence. Often, for migrant women, the violence to be re-elaborated is both that experienced in the country of origin and that suffered during the migration journey and/or in the host country. For the success of the projects, the center provides women with legal support, psychological support, art therapy, economic support, group empowerment courses and training for professional purposes. A great deal of importance is given to support for self-care and health, also making available the consolidated experience of the operators in accompanying young women on the delicate path of pregnancy first and motherhood later. The timescales of these projects are generally long (18/24 months) and end when the woman has reached economic and housing autonomy.
