## Technologies

- For the frontend, we have used Nuxt 3 with tailwindcss for the style;
- For the backend, we have used NodeJS with Express;
- For the database, we have use SupaBase,
- For the deployment we have used Vercel, the website is accessible online through this link :

## Responsiveness

The website was built with responsiveness as a key priority. Each element is designed to adapt and alter its appearance accordingly. For instance, on smaller devices like smartphones or tablets, the full navigation bar is concealed and replaced by a hamburger menu. Additionally, the grids and paragraphs adjust to display only one element per line when the viewport size is limited. The chatbot window is also configured to be displayed correctly on any screen size.

## Running the website on your device

In a shell :
- `git clone ...`;
- in the files : create a .env file and import OPENAI_API_KEY, SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_KEY;
- `cd hmw-app`
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

To build :
- `npm run build`
