## Usability Evaluation Review

---

This [report](deliverables/Giannunzio,%20Guglielmelli,%20LeBizec-USABILITY%20Report-17-07-2024.pdf) shows the usability evaluation of the website [Unicef.org](https://Unicef.org).
Usability evaluation aims at giving the client some clues to improve the product’s quality and to fix possible issues.

## Web Technology Project

---

This is our website: [Women's Solidarity Center](https://hypermedia-web-app.vercel.app/).
The purpose of the Web Technology Project is the development of a website.

Should you see errors or the website does not load, probably it is caused by the free database host service of Supabase that deactivates itself after 1 week of disuse.

Should you see errors in the ChatBox Window, probably it is because the $5 budget in OpenAI API have been spent.

The prompt used for the chatbot is available in this [file](hmw-app/components/systemMessage.js).

## Build Setup

---

To install the fundamental dependencies:

`npm install`

To open the website hosted locally at localhost:3000:

`npm run dev -- -o`
